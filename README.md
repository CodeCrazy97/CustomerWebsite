# CustomerWebsite
Demonstrates my ability to create an HTML-based website that uses PHP to interact with a MySQL database.

This program allows a "customer" to request product information buy products.

For this to work, you must download all files and run the SQL script. Then, you can open the test2.html file in your favorite browser.
